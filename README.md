# odin-landing-page
This project is a part of The Odin Project: Foundations Course. This project is meant to demonstrate my ability to use flexbox to get my webpage to look like this design as much as possible https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png, not UI design. Image used is taken by Beth Garrabrant and belonged to Taylor Swift or Republic Records.
